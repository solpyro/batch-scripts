: An Alt-Reality RTS
====================

BACKSTORY
---------

During the Golden Age of Scientific Disciovery and Invention, The British
Crown, while expanding it's empire, established a  number of institutions
devoted to aspects of Science and Technology.

While these institutions developed and publicised exciting scientific
breakthroughs, their true purpose was to research the next wave of weapons
for the Crown.

As the knowledge-base of the institutions grew, they started to make 
designs on the Country for themselves, resulting in a civil war which
quickly spread through the empire, fracturing it into three areas,
controlled by three of the main institutions.

As the war between the factions grew to a stalemate, each new state
looked outward to the rest of the un-conqured world. Unable to put up
any real defense against the technological super-powers, all resistance
was swept aside and the world was lost.

The age of the Institutions had begun...

INSTITUTIONS

Botanists	Formerly the RHS. They have collected and grown samples of
(Bio-punk)	all the plants on earth, splicing and crossing the specemins
			to create a selection of botanical tools and weapons.

Engineers	Concerning themselves with the beauty of design and the 
(Steampunk)	brute force of steam, this group create mechanical suits and
			weapons using the very latest in steam powered technology.

[Cyber]		A schism from the Engineers, they have forsaken the artistry
(Cyberpunk)	of mechanics in favour of the lighter-weight silicon chips,
			creating a range of robotic war-fighters.
